# Symbio Amplicon Pipeline

### This repository contains recent versions of scripts, and supplemental files, for the analysis of quantitative multi-target amplicon sequencing data that were developed and used used by the Symbiosis Evolution Group at Jagiellonian University.  
  
Earlier versions of the tools were developed as a collaborative effort of several group members and collaborators, including ..., and can be found at

This document will evolve dramatically over the next few months, and so here are the preliminary information needed to get the lab members started on amplicon data analysis.
  
1. Before you receive the multi-target amplicon sequencing data for your biological samples:  
   - Make sure that you have the full list of samples, with metadata - sample origin, collection date, experimental treatment... These data will form the core of one of your Supplementary Table 1.  
   - Make sure that you have the list of marker regions that you were amplifying, with information on primer sequences.  
   - Make sure that you have laboratory protocols written down.  
  
3. You want to make sure that you have the latest versions of the analysis scripts and additional files. If you work on one of the Institute of Environmental Sciences clusters, you want to ensure that you have folder **/mnt/qnap/users/symbio/SymbioAmpliconPipeline/** in your PATH. Alternatively, you may want to clone the current repository and add it to your PATH.
  
4. Once you receive the data, you want to start from breaking it up into bins corresponding to different targetted regions.
